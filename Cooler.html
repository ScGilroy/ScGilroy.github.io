  <h4>Inspiration</h4>
  <p class="tab">Initially, this project was inspired by my Heat and Mass Transfer course as an undergraduate student at Stony Brook University. The original project was to design a Portable A/C Unit for a golf cart for which golfers could bring with them on the course to cool down. Afterward, I took this project and spun it around to be a portable cooler for a small enclosed environment.</p>

  <h4>Conceptual Design</h4>
  <p class="tab">The project expanded my undergraduate knowledge in heat and mass transfer in pipes. Market research was conducted on products and to determine beneficial features. A conceptual design was produced in which air was pushed through a set of pipes submerged under ice water, powered by a small fan. Afterward, the air exits near the top through a nozzle which allows for either a diffuser or hose to be attached. Overall, the heat exchanged calculates for an estimated temperature of 68F to be output from the nozzle/diffuser by utilizing Reynold's number, friction factor, and heat transfer equations.</p>

  <h2>Flaws</h2>
  <p class="tab">Looking back, the design has multiple flaws. There are multiple right-angle bends in the pipe to drastically head pressure and decrease model accuracy. Second, the design utilizes cooling down the air from the environment which more heat transfer will need to be removed to get it cooler.</p>

  <h4>Portable A/C and Beverage Cooler</h4>
  <p class="tab">In the latest design, I aimed to cool down small enclosed spaces that could be useful for tents, RV's, or power outages. I took inspiration by having a heat exchanger design and by utilizing the air to be cooled down from a new source.</p>

  <h2>Addressing the Flaws</h2>
  <p class="tab">The new design now does not utilize pipes for heat transfer but instead uses a heat exchanger which forced convection will occur over. This in turn should remove the potential issue of right-angled pipes and now has curves to guide the airflow. Additionally, instead of cooling down the outside air, the system now uses the air from within the cooler itself. This air has already has started the process of cooling down and will start at a lower temperature.</p>

  <h2>The Design</h2>
  <p class="tab">Overall, the design consists of four major parts: the base, lid, heat sink, and divider. The base has been designed for looks while also providing a convenient method of insulating the interior ice water from the outside environment. This part features four feet which elevate the cooler off the ground, further insulating the cooler from the environment.</p>

  <p class="tab">The lid provides housing for the battery and 140mm fan within a storage compartment. Also, the lid provides two standard cup holders for your favorite canned beverage. In the center is a vent which is the output for the A/C functionality. Internally, ducts can be found which provides an avenue for the air to get from the heat exchanger to the vent to be expelled. A 140mm fan is located right before the vent, pushing the cool air towards the user.</p>

  <p class="tab">The divider is designed to contour to the shape of the cooler's base. The main object for this part is to prevent air from near the top of the cooler to be sucked through and directed into the ducts in the lid. If this were to occur, the air would bypass the heat exchanged and would not be cooled even further. Small vent cutouts are therefore placed nearing the middle of the divider. Additionally, a large square is cut out from the bottom to allow for ice to directly touch the fins of the heat exchanger further cooling down the metal. Lastly, this part directs the airflow from the heat exchanger to a smaller opening at the top.</p>

  <p class="tab">The heat exchanger is the most important part of the A/C functionality of the device. Because we want to remove as much heat from the air as quickly as possible, aluminum was chosen due to its good thermal conductivity properties. The heat exchanger was inspired by the heat-sinks on modern-day electronics which they use for passive cooling. Likewise, by being submerged in ice water, the metal will near 0C leading to a large temperature difference for heat transfer. With the fins pointing towards the divider, air will be directed within the fins cooling it down before reaching the vent above.</p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p class="tab">Overall the newest design fixes many of the issues which I have noticed with the first design. Although I have not completed the thermal calculations to calculate the exit temperature, the design will provide a better result than the first iteration.</p>
