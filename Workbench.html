  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <h2>Project Inspiration</h2>
  <p class="tabMid">The main source of inspiration for this project comes from my old workbench and popular makers such as Mark Rober. Between these sources, I iterated over the course of a few designs until I was satisfied with the design of the workbench.</p>

  <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
  <p class="tabMid">The overall dimensions of the workbench are based upon a large unused cubby in my garage. Next to the workbench, I wanted to have enough space to store a larger machine such as a scroll saw. I then sketched a small diagram marking out key dimensions in the garage which landed me on the workbench to be 68 inches long. Afterward, I started to iterate on my designs where the first two iterations can be seen below.</p>

  <h4>Final Design</h4>
  <p class="tabMid">Once the design was finalized, I modeled the workbench using AutoDesk Inventor. After creating the model, I was able to calculate exactly the quantity of each material was needed. </p>
  <p class="tabMid">This led me to areas that would be difficult during assembly. Firstly, the shelves would have to be correctly spaced apart to allow for larger power tools to be placed on the bottom shelf while allowing enough space to accommodate other materials and tools on the top shelf. Additionally, I found less than optimal joining configurations of the 2x4's. While there are techniques to correctly and easily join the 2x4's in these configurations, I did not have access to the correct equipment to machine mortise and tenon joints. To strength the build and make assembly easier, I decided to add right-angle brackets in these locations.</p>

  <h4>Materials and Assembly</h4>
  <p class="tabMid">The quantities of all materials can be found in the Bill of Materials located in the Project Files at the top of this page. The workbench is broken down into two major assemblies; the table and the backboard. Both of these major assemblies utilize 2x4 of various lengths, 2.5-inch / 3-inch screws, and plywood. To address the problem areas discussed previously, right-angle brackets were added to ease assembly.</p>

  <h2> Additional Parts </h2>
  <p class="tabMid">Four stainless steel pegboards were purchased with additional red pegs from amazon to be used on the backboard. LED lighting is screwed into the top plywood and provides direct lighting over the workbench top. A powerstrip was added on the right side (near the pegboard) to allow for easy access to an outlet. I added a sheet of plexiglass above the bottom shelf, to prevent scratching and extend the lifetime of the plywood on the shelf. Lastly, I applied a layer of dark brown stain on the surface of all the wood just for added detail.</p>
