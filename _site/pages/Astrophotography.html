  <h4>Telescope Background</h4>
  <p class="tab">To begin, I needed a deeper understanding of telescopes and astrophotography image processing than what I currently had from taking courses on physics. I already owned a small 4 inch Schmidt-Cassegrain Telescope (SCT) and refractor telescope which I have become good at focusing on objects in the night sky. The SCT has the largest aperture of my current telescopes and therefore has a larger magnification potential.</p>

  <h2>Planetary vs Deep Space Photography</h2>
  <p class="tab">Planetary Photography and Deep Space Photography are very different sides of the spectrum of Astrophotography. Planetary photography deals with the moons and planets within our solar system. These objects oftentimes require a telescope with a large aperture to have enough magnification to capture a clear image of the body. The cameras usually have high FPS to capture multiple images without much movement of the planet. Post-processing can later overlay the images creating a more clear final image. Deep-space photography on the other hand utilizes long exposures to gather as much light. The light gathered can show distant stars or even nebulas but requires post-processing for clear results.</p>

  <h4>Go Pro Attachment</h4>
  <p class="tab">Initially, I sketched out a design to attach my Go Pro to a 1-inch eyepiece. I developed this sketch to balance the Go Pro and align the lens with the center of the eyepiece. A second part was created to hold the eyepiece and prevent slipping. Both pieces are then slid into the main piece. By aligning the lens of the Go Pro with the eyepiece, I was able to easily capture nice images of the Moon since it is a very bright and large object in the night sky. This iteration still needs testing on deep-space photography which is hard to do in a light-polluted suburb.</p>

  <p class="Desc">Concept Drawing for the Camera Mount.</p>

  <p class="tab">The Go Pro seen in black in the previous image would be centered in line with the eyepiece. The eyepiece will be swappable via a slot in the 3D print. The mount is also located after the right angle reflector to ensure the Go Pro will not fall out when moving the telescope to a more vertical facing direction. After the drawing was created, I transferred the ideas I had into CAD using Inventor.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="Desc">3D Model for the Go Pro Attachment with Eyepiece Slot.</p>

  <p class="tab">The eyepiece attachment was created to hold another small plastic part that slides into the bottom groove. This part accepts an m3 bolt which is threaded through the small hole to ensure the 3D printed part will not slip out of the eyepiece.</p>

  <h4>iPhone Attachment</h4>
  <p class="tab">The iPhone provides better quality images in comparison to the Go Pro so I decided to expand the telescope mounts to account for my iPhone 8+. Since the lens is at the top left, it became tricky to stabilize the phone. Also, I wanted to design a print from which I could easily attach and detach my phone. I designed a simple sketch on a concept which I thought would work. Since my iPhone has a case, I designed it with the case in mind.</p>

  </div>
  <p class="Desc">3D Model for the iPhone Attachment with Eyepiece Slot.</p>

  <p class="tab">The eyepiece will attach by sliding into the hole from where the iPhone rests then placing the iPhone into the slot. This will prevent the eyepiece from popping out, and the case on the phone will prevent the eyepiece from touching the camera's lens/glass. The tab that is overhanging helps the iPhone keep the needed pressure for this to work. This part relies on tight tolerances for the eyepiece to prevent the part from rotating. From the drawing, the part follows the eyepiece down which will allow me to mate the right-angle adapter to the 3D print which will remove the slack and keep the iPhone more steady when it comes time to take images.</p>


  <h4>Ongoing Developments</h4>
  <p class="tab">Currently, I am further testing the current design to see the extent of these designs on capturing images on planets rather than just the moon. I believe I am able to capture images of Saturn and Jupiter since they have distinct features. Mars and Venus will be harder to capture since they are much smaller. Additionally, I want to try capturing images pointing the telescope into space to see if the camera will pick up any interesting features which cannot be seen by eye. This project is still undergoing and I hope to post more images below as I acquire them.</p>
