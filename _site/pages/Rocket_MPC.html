  <h4>Project Motivation</h4>
  <p class="tab">I was lucky enough to have been in Florida near Cape CanaveralStarting from the same Initial Conditions, each model was run until an optimal solution was found and the thrust values were compared. The thrust for the first case, landing without grid fins led to a thrust value to be consistently above the minimum allowed while cases 2 and 3 utilized the grid fins with the minimum thrust to slow the rocket down, then right before landing the thrusters turned on further limiting the rocket's speed for a safe landin at the time of a SpaceX Rocket launch which was destined to resupply the International Space Station. I was able to see through the rocket split just as it went behind the clouds. Additionally, I took a course at Berkeley on Model Predictive Control (ME 231a) which allowed me to develop an optimal control problem to land a rocket with and without grid fins. Between both of these, I decided to develop a Rocket Landing MPC.</p>

  <p class="Desc">SpaceX Falcon 9 Rocket Heading Towards the International Space Station (May 4th, 2019).</p>

  <h4>Rocket Model</h4>
  <p class="tab">The rocket is a planar model with some assumptions to reduce the overall nonlinear nature of the dynamics. Being planar, the states associated with the model are (x, y, theta, dx, dy, dtheta) which account for the position, heading and velocities of the rocket. The model and dynamics are defined as the following: </p>

  <p class="Desc">Rocket Model used (Grid Fins not Present).</p>

  <h4>Take Off MPC</h4>
  <p class="tab">The take-off stage of the rocket relies solely on the gimbaled nature of the thruster and the amount of thrust. Formulating a Constrained Finite Time-Optimal Control (CFTOC) and MPC allowed me to test the overall dynamics without having to worry about the influence of the grid fins. By testing the overall dynamics I was allowed to determine if an optimal solution would be possible to achieve.</p>

  <h2>Assumptions</h2>
  <p  class="tab">Using the small-angle approximation for the gimbaled thrusters allows the dynamics to reduce some nonlinearities which will aid in the optimization. The dynamics are still nonlinear due to the rocket orientation's impact on the x and y dynamics. Additionally, we use the assumption that the mass remains constant throughout the duration of the take-off and landing.</p>

  <p class="Desc">Optimal Solution to Launch the Rocket to (-100m, 1750m, 0 rad) with no velocities in 30s.</p>

  <h2>Take Off Results</h2>
  <p class="tab"> Overall, the MPC and simulations provided promising results in which the rocket can successfully find an optimal control to launch to a specific state within a specific time. This reconfirms the current dynamics and ensures that all the base files utilized between the different models are correct and can be expanded upon.</p>

  <h4>Landing MPCs</h4>
  <h2>Landing Without Grid Fins</h2>
  <p class="tab">Landing without grid fins provides a benchmark on the amount of thrust is needed to land. This will result in a representative on the ratio of how much fuel is consumed in comparison to the other configurations. The gimbaled thrusters will account for any movement needed in the x-axis for the rocket to successfully hit the ending location of (0m, 0m).</p>

  <h2>Landing With Opening Grid Fins</h2>
  <p class="tab">This model configuration allows for the grid fins to open up and rotate outwards of the body. This method is not the method in which SpaceX deploys their grid fins but will provide a base solution on the impact of grid fins. This method would likely exhibit large stresses which is very much non-ideal.</p>

  <h2>Landing With Grid Fins Modeled After the Falcon 9</h2>
  <p class="tab">This model has the grid fins pivot around the z-axis (based on the axis defined in the first image) which is how SpaceX deploys the grid fins. Since the model is 2D, the two grid fins (overlapped in the animation), are constrained to be the same angle. If the angles are different, the rocket would experience a rotation around the y-axis and therefore would be non-ideal in the case of 3D.</p>

  <h4>The Optimization Problem</h4>
  <p  class="tab">The optimization utilizing fmincon solved the optimization with limited constraints. The first constraints used were state and input limitations while additional constraints were added, reducing the change in grid fin angles between steps. Other constraints such as a vertical height are always decreasing, and a constraint for the rocket to converge to the correct x-axis value before the y-axis helped smooth out the optimization to a more feasible solution.</p>

  <h4>The Results on Landing</h4>
  <p class="tab">The following are the results for the previously discussed methods of landing: (Grid fins are not to scale)</p>

  <h2>Fuel Comparison on Rocket Landings</h2>
  <p class="tab">Starting from the same Initial Conditions, each model was run until an optimal solution was found and the thrust values were compared. The thrust for the first case, landing without grid fins led to a thrust value to be consistently above the minimum allowed while cases 2 and 3 utilized the grid fins with the minimum thrust to slow the rocket down, then right before landing the thrusters turned on further limiting the rocket's speed for a safe landing. This leads to cases 2 and 3 requiring less overall thrust and therefore less fuel needed to land.</p>
