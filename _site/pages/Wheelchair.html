  <h4>Design Parameters</h4>
  <p class="tab">For a successful design, the torque and velocity ratios are a pivotal design parameter. To accommodate users on inclines, a higher torque ratio should be used which would reduce the amount of strain the user experiences when applying force to move or stay still. With this, the velocity ratio would be lower. Additionally, the rotation of the ratcheting lever should be opposite to the way the wheel rotates. The user will therefore use a rowing-like motion rather than a pushing motion to move forwards.</p>

  <h4>Concept Designs</h4>
  <h2>Design 1:</h2>
  <p class="tab">The first design is a very simple design that utilizes the meshing of two gears. A ratching lever is connected to the offset driver gear which provides some mechanical advantage to the user based upon the gear ratio. This design is not robust enough since there is a possibility of the gear slipping. In the image below, the driver gear has 30 teeth and the driven gear has 45 teeth giving a reduction in speed but an increase in torque. Additionally, the motion of the wheel rotates opposite direction, so pulling the lever moves the user forward.</p>

  <h2>Design 2:</h2>
  <p class="tab">The second design utilizes a planetary gear system. The sun gear is the driven gear, the planets and sun remain fixed while the ring gear rotates. The ring gear is connected directly to the wheel which rotates in the opposite direction. The sun gear is directly connected to the ratcheting lever to aid the user to apply the torque needed with greater ease. In the image below, the sun, planet, and ring gear have 52, 26, and 104 teeth respectively. Also, these gears are 3, 1.5, and 6 inches respectively. This results in an inversion of direction between the sun and ring gears with a lower speed on the ring but an increased torque ratio applied.</p>

  <h4>3D Design</h4>
  <p class="tab">The design was modeled using Autodesk Inventor which features one the wheel with the desired planetary gear system with ratcheting lever. The body of the wheelchair is not present nor the method of attachment to the body itself. Additionally, the edges of the ring gear should have a lip to prevent the planet gears from slipping out over time. The ratcheting lever is simplified but a design similar to socket wrench which allows for torque to be applied in a certain direction but can freely rotate in the opposite would be perfect for the application of required torque.</p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p class="tab">A simple planetary gear system allows wheelchair users to operate their wheelchairs in a more natural motion, leading to better posture and quality of life. As demonstrated in the animation, the sun gear can be cranked in one direction and can be retracted in the opposite. This causes the ring gear to rotate in the opposite direction, propelling the user forwards. This project has been interesting by seeing how a simple change to a device that is widely used and remains mostly unchanged, can have potentially a significant impact on the user's experience.</p>
