    title: About Me
    text: I am a recent Master's graduate from the University of California, Berkeley in which I studied Mechanical Engineering and focused on the concentration of Robotics and Controls. I performed my Master's thesis under the supervision of Dr. Koushil Sreenath on Jumping with the MIT Mini Cheetah through an obstacle. Previously I worked as an R&D Engineer at Air Techniques in their dental imaging department which gathered experience with design verification, prototyping, and product improvements. <br> <br> Currently, in my free time, I continue to work towards finishing personal projects and advancing my previous algorithm which was developed for my Master's thesis. I am very passionate about continuing my learning and further refining my skill set.
