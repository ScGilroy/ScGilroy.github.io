  <h4>Project Motivation</h4>
  <p class="tab">Throughout history, quadrupedal animals often have been pictured to jump through a constrained opening such as a hoop. This has been seen in circuses, where tigers jump through hoops, or even in dog shows where dogs are trained to jump through openings on command. With this, my team and I decided to develop a trajectory optimization and onboard controller to enable a quadruped to jump through a hoop and land safely.</p>

  <h4>Approach Overview</h4>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/projects/Forward_Jump/Computations.png" style="width:80%; height:auto;">
  <p class="tab">This project is broken down into two separate computation steps, offline and online. The offline step consists of the trajectory optimization development while the online step consists of the onboard controller for the joints.</p>

  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/projects/Forward_Jump/Phases.png" style="width:80%; height:auto;">
  <p class="tab">To create a successful jump, the jumping trajectory was broken down into multiple phases which are the stance, flight, and landing phases. The stance and flight phases are the main focus of the project. My team and I developed two process flow diagrams to represent the actions in each phase. The stance phase is where the optimization occurs and lasts until right before the robot leaves the ground. The flight phase is then computed based on the theoretical projectile motion values for jump height and distance.</p>


  <h2>Stance Phase</h2>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/projects/Forward_Jump/Stance_Process_Flow.png" style="width:80%; height:auto;">
  <p class="tab">The stance phase starts with the trajectory optimization my team and I developed which is ran offline to generate a dataset for the joint angles, velocities, and torques with time. This dataset is then interpolated to create a dataset at the same rate as the CPU clock speed. These trajectories are then inputted into a library in which the quadruped will use the hoop's parameters to determine which trajectory will be the best for the robot to succeed in completing the jump. Afterward, the quadruped loads the data in C++ where the data is then partitioned into subvectors from the matrix of inputted data. For the duration of the stance phase, an estimation of the maximum height and distance is computed based on projectile motion equations. This will give the robot a good representation of what will be expected for the jumps parameters. These parameters are stored and updated as the quadruped runs through the dataset. The partitioned data is then run through a Proportional-Derivative Controller (PD) with a feedforward value on the joint torque which is computed during the optimization. The robot then takes action and the IMU/Encoders provide feedback which is used in the next iteration.</p>

  <h2>Flight Phase</h2>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/projects/Forward_Jump/Flight_Process_Flow.png" style="width:80%; height:auto;">
  <p class="tab">During the flight phase, the flight configuration prediction which was calculated during the stance phase is primarily used. The quadruped takes this information and interpolates the take-off joint configuration to the calculated flight configuration. This is possible by using the theoretical time to the apex of the flight through projectile motion. Once the robot reaches the apex, the interpolation then switches back to bringing the joints to a safe landing configuration. Additionally, there are no torques for feedforward so this portion of the controller solely relies on feedback control.</p>

  <h4>Optimization</h4>
  <h2>Quadruped Model</h2>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/projects/Forward_Jump/Planar_Model.png" style="width:80%; height:auto;">
  <p class="tab">For faster optimization convergence, the quadruped model can be reduced to a 2D model depicted as a planar model along the sagittal plane. With this model, the robot can be reduced to having point mass links, half the body mass, and two legs. This reduces the states in the optimization by half from 36 states in 3D to just 14 in 2D. Forward jumping allows us to make this reduction because we can have the abduction joint maintain zero rotation Additionally, we can bound the quadruped's front and back legs to accomplish the jump.</p>

  <h2>Optimization Stance Phase</h2>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/projects/Forward_Jump/Cheetah_Squat.gif" style="width:40%; height:auto;">
  <p class="tab">The optimization occurs strictly during the stance phase only, which develops a trajectory that optimizes from a squatting configuration to just before leaving the ground. We will be optimizing a trajectory to generate the needed velocities center of mass velocity at take-off to clear the obstacle.</p>

  <h4>Onboard Control</h4>
  <h2>Joint Controls</h2>
  <p class="tab">The joint based controller is a PD Controller with a feedforward value for torque. This is applied for all 12 joints and the duration of all phases of stance and flight. The feedforward torque value is only applied during the stance phase and comes directly from the optimization.</p>

  <h2>Breaking Ground Contact</h2>
  <p class="tab">To leave the ground, the quadruped is required to lock the joints right before take-off. This will reduce the forces on the feet to 0 Newtons which is exactly when the robot breaks contact with the ground.</p>
  <img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/files/projects/Forward_Jump/Breaking_GC.gif" style="width:40%; height:auto;">
  <p class="tab">In the example above, the quadruped was given a trajectory for a small vertical jump. Once the robot goes through the trajectory, the joints are locked and the robot leaves the ground.</p>

  <h2>Tuck Phase</h2>
  <p class="tab">The tuck angles are calculated as apart of the Flight Predictive Parameters during the stance phase. These angles are computed to allow for the quadruped to tuck into a configuration that is 75% the diameter of the hoop. This is required due to the parabolic trajectories that are experienced by projectile motion. Once the robot leaves the ground, the tuck phase begins. The robot then interpolates and using feedback control, the quadruped moves to the final tuck iteration quickly.</p>

  <h2>Extension Phase</h2>
  <p class="tab">Once the quadruped is within the hoop, the extension phase starts. This phase brings the quadruped from the tuck configuration to a safe configuration for landing. Extending the legs forward, the quadruped will be in a configuration to decelerate without exceeding hardware limitations.</p>

  <h4>Results</h4>
  <h2>Small Vertical Jump Experiments</h2>
  <p class="tab">Due to COVID-19 appearing midway through the project, my team and I were forced to conduct experiments over Zoom with some colleagues. Initially, we began with a small simple jump to ensure the controllers were functioning correctly. Note in the experiment that the flight phase (tuck and extension) was disabled due to the low flight time.</p>

  <p class="tab">We then moved to more simulation-based results since the space for experiments was limited. We were able to get the quadruped to successfully jump through a hoop with all phases enabled in simulation.</p>
