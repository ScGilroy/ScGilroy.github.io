  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p class="tab">The solar system, like many other natural occurrences, follows strict laws which have been discovered by past mathematicians. The main contributors to the physics behind the motion were Newton and Kepler. Between both of these mathematicians, one can accurately model how the planets orbit each other using forces.</p>

  <h4>Terminology</h4>
  <p class="tab">Orbital dynamics utilize terminology to define orbital parameters. The parameters which are used within the code are the object's mass, radius, and velocity as well as the orbits' inclination, eccentricity, aphelion, and perihelion. Most of these parameters are defined in the following image.</p>

  <h4>Approaches</h4>
  <h2>Ellipse Based Approach</h2>
  <p class="tab">The orbits of planets generally take the shape of an ellipse in 3D space. How non-circular the obit is, depends on the eccentricity of the planet's ellipse. By using simple geometry with the planet's parameters, the orbit can be approximated. While this method gives a good approximation, it is nearly impossible to model the moons since they experience a sine wave-like orbit. Additionally, the orbits deviate over time due to the small disturbances of other planets in other positions in space. While this method has its drawbacks, the code runs very fast and many objects can be modeled and ran very quickly. I used this method as an introduction to modeling the planets in the solar system and to motivate me by seeing the potential outcome of using the force-based method. Overall this method featured all the planets and modeled the asteroid belt by using a normal distribution.</p>

  <p class="centeredDesc">Ellipse Method - Time is sped up to show movements, planets and asteroids are enlarged to see.</p>

  <h2>Forced Based Approach</h2>
  <p class="tab">The force-based approach is a much more complex approach and requires much longer computation times depending on the duration in which the solar system is simulated. The benefits of this method are that it allows a more accurate representation of the position of the object since all objects have a direct impact on the gravitational forces experienced. Additionally, moons can be modeled with the same equations of motion. To speed up runtime when animating the data, I have exported the position dataset to be reloaded into the animator. For this method to work, accurate velocity and initial position are required. I tuned these parameters slightly from the values provided by NASA. Additionally, this model only contains bodies with significant importance or size. This means that the asteroid belt is not modeled since it would exponentially increase computation time when simulating the model for many years. Overall, this method provided an accurate representation of over 25 planets and moons in the solar system.</p>

  <p class="tab"> Planets and Moons were simulated for 971.3 years (took ~2 hours to generate 170 million data points) which is one complete orbit of the dwarf planet Eris. Data after one complete orbit of each planet was removed (to reduce storage size) and the data points for one orbit was saved. The simulation can then be played back with the data aquired.</p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p class="tab">This project was a large motivator for some of my other space-related projects. While the ellipse approach utilized geometry to speed through simulation, it lacked realism which can be associated with the laws of motion. The second approach used these laws of motion from Newton and Kepler and allowed for the Solar System to accurately model planets, moons, and other bodies very closely.</p>

  <h4>Future Work</h4>
  <p class="tab">In the future, I plan to model rockets that will follow an optimized trajectory between planets, moons, or orbits with a simplified model of the solar system (to speed up the optimization process). Additionally, the simulator could directly take the current planetary position from NASA's website and simulate their orbit into the future instead of starting from an arbitrary position.</p>
